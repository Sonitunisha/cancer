# Project Name
> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- To classify type of skin disease.
- Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths.?
- Evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis?
- This assignment uses a dataset of about 2357 images of skin cancer types. The dataset contains 9 sub-directories in each train and test subdirectories. The 9 sub-directories contains the images of 9 skin cancer types respectively.?

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
-By use of Augmentor , accuracy on training data has increased.

After using Augmentor, we can model is still overfitting

To solve problem of overfitting , we can add more layer,neurons or adding dropout layers.

Hyperparameter can be used to improve model
